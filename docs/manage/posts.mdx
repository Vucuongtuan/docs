:::danger NOTE

Next, we will go into detail about each field:

#### 1. Title

The title is the main heading of the post. The post title appears in some places such as:

In **Home Page**
![Post title in Home](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/post-title-in-home.png)

In **Article Detail**
![Post title in Home](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/post-title-article-detail.png)

And anywhere the post is displayed.

#### 2. Excerpt

Excerpt is the short summary that helps readers understand the post content.

Unlike the title, the excerpt is only displayed in certain places, such as the **Home Page**.

![Post excerpt](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/post-excerpt.png)

#### 3. Content

You can write the detailed content of post here.

We provide a **rich text** editor that allows you to create headings, media, text styles, and more.

For more detail abour **rich text**, refer [this section](/docs/sections/richtext#4-text-editor).

#### 4. Slug

The slug is the URL-friendly identifier of post. And in the website, we use the slug along with `.html` to determine a post's URL.

![Post slug](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/post-slug.png)
:::tip TIP
The slug can be **auto-generated** from **title**. So, when creating a new post, you can leave the slug field empty.
:::

:::danger NOTE
Slug must be **unique**. If you create a slug that already exists, the system will return an error.
:::

#### 5. Thumbnail

You can upload the post thumbnail here.

You can **Create new**, **Choose from existing**, or **Drag and Drop** a file.

When you **Create new**, you can either **Select a file** or **Paste URL**. Additionally, you can set the **Alt** text and **Caption** when selecting the image.

After successfully selecting an image, you have two available actions:

![Post thumbnail actions](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/post-thumbnail-operations.png)

| No.   | Component | Description                                                                                       |

Example of thumbnail interface:

![Post thumbnail](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/post-thumbnail-v2.png)
