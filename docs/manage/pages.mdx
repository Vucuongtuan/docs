For more detail about sections, see [this section](/docs/category/sections).

#### 4. Slug

The slug is a URL-friendly of the page.

In the website, the slug is used when user access a specific page.

:::tip TIP
The slug can be **auto-generated** from **title**. So, when creating a new page, you can leave the slug field empty.
:::

:::danger NOTE
Slug must be **unique**. If you create a slug that already exists, the system will return an error.
:::

By default, the page URL follows the format `[website-domain]/page/[slug]`. However, you can check the **Show as top-level** option to shorten URL to `[website-domain]/[slug]`. This allows users to access the page directly without the `/page` prefix.
