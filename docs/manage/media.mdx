To learn more about table views and common content management operations such as creating, searching, etc., please refer to [this section](../getting-started/overview#collections).

- **Select a file**: Choose a file from your local machine.
- **Paste URL**: Paste the media URL to import it.

You can also set the **Alt** text and **Caption** during upload.

Once the file is uploaded, you can rename it:

:::danger NOTE
The file name must be **unique**. If you use a file name that already exists, the system will return an error.

If you uploaded an image, our system also provides an advanced feature called **Edit Image**, which allows you to crop the image and set a **focal point**.

To use this feature, simply click **Edit Image**:

![Media edit image](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/media-edit-image.png)

Next, refer to the detailed sections below for how to use cropping and focal point features.

### Crop

To crop the image, hover near its edges until the resize cursor appears. Then, drag to adjust the size.

You can also manually adjust the **Width** and **Height** in the form next to the image:

To revert to the original size, click **Reset**:

![Crop reset](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/crop-reset.png)

Once you're happy with the changes, click **Apply Changes**.

### Focal Point

To ensure key content isn't cropped when resizing, you can set a **focal point**.

A `+` symbol will appear in the center of the imageâ€”this is the **focal point**.

![Focal point](https://wvn.hcm.ss.bfcplatform.vn/uploads/focal-point.png)

Drag the focal point to the most important area of the image. The **X** and **Y** values in the form will update accordingly.

You can also enter these values manually:
